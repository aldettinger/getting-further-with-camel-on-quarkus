Abstract:
---------
Apache Camel is the proven integration swiss knife for years. In today's world of workloads moving to the cloud, the need for disparate systems to communicate remains more than ever. This context makes a Kubernetes Java stack like Quarkus a good fit to implement Camel routes.

In this session, the attendance can first expect a quick reminder about Camel Quarkus basics. Beyond, some day to day useful features will be presented via concrete examples. Finally, a demo will illustrate the interest of running Camel Quarkus on top of Knative.

Presenter:
----------

Alexandre is an Apache Camel contributor, working mainly on camel-quarkus those days.
He is also Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat.
